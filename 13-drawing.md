# Drawing

## Drawing Tips and Tricks

- Pencil tool allows freehand drawing

- Pen tool allows vector shapes by auto-connecting individual points

    - Pen tool also allows curved lines by click-and-drag

## Squircle Buttons with iOS Rounded Corners (Corner Smoothing)

- "Squircles" are created by applying corner smoothing to shapes that already have a non-zero corner radius value

## Boolean Union, Subtract, Intersect, Exclude

- Boolean Union joins two shapes (regardless of if they overlap or not)

- Boolean Substract removes lower z-index shapes from higher z-index shapes

- Boolean Intersect only retains overlapping portions of shapes

- Boolean Exclude removes lower z-index shapes from higher z-index shapes but retains any sections of the lower z-index shapes that do not overlap with the higher z-index shapes

## Union vs Flatten

- Union is a non-destructive action for joining shapes and flatten is a destructive action for joining shapes
