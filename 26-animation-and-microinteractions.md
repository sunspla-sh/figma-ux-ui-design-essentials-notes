# Animation and Microinteractions

## The Difference Between Animations and Microinteractions

- Microinteractions are short and simple visual cues such as loading bars, spinners, hover effects, etc to indicate that some user action is possible or in-progress

- Animations are visual cues that are meant to delight/entertain the user while the application transitions between different states (and are typically longer and more complex than microinteractions, although microinteractions can be considered a subset of animations)

## Animation with Custom Easing

- Within the Prototype panel, the "smart animate" setting of the "navigate to" interaction can be used to animate objects between positions in two different frames as long as their top-level frames have the same name or prefix

- The "custom easing" setting of the "navigate to" interaction allows controlling the speed of the easing animation

## Class Project 18 - My Second Animation

- Create an animation for the confirmation page (after someone purchases your product) using at least 3 frames and an icon representing your product

## How to Make Animated Transitions

- One or more frames can be used to build an animation that occurs on page transition (following the same principles from the "Animation with Custom Easing" section)

## Class Project 19 - Page Transition

- Add an animation that occurs on  page transition between the Home page and the Product Details page when the "Learn More" button is clicked on the Home page

## Microinteractions Using Interactive Components

- Interactive component sets allow microinteractions to occur when the user takes a specific action such as hovering over a button component or clicking a checkbox component

## Microinteraction Toggle Switch

- Make an interactive component set for a toggle switch that changes between two variants when clicked, then use the "smart animate" setting to smooth the transition between the "on" and "off" variants of the the component set

## Microinteraction Burger Menu

- Make an interactive component set for a burger menu icon that changes between two variants when clicked, then use the "smart animate" setting to smooth the transition between the "open" and "closed" variants of the the component set

## Class Project 20 - Microinteraction

- Add two microinteractions to any of your pages

    - The first microinteraction must be a burger menu icon that turns into a cross when clicked

    - The second microinteraction can be anything you want

- Make sure you're using interactive component sets with multiple variants that transition between eachother when some action occurs (e.g. on click, on hover, etc.)
