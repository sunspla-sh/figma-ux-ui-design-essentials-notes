# Animation and Microinteractions

## The Difference Between Animations and Microinteractions

- Microinteractions are short and simple visual cues such as loading bars, spinners, hover effects, etc to indicate that some user action is possible or in-progress

- Animations are visual cues that are meant to delight/entertain the user while the application transitions between different states (and are typically longer and more complex than microinteractions, although microinteractions can be considered a subset of animations)

## Animation with Custom Easing

- Within the Prototype panel, the "smart animate" setting of the "navigate to" interaction can be used to animate objects between positions in two different frames as long as their top-level frames have the same name or prefix

- The "custom easing" setting of the "navigate to" interaction allows controlling the speed of the easing animation

## Class Project 18 - My Second Animation

- Create an animation for the confirmation page (after someone purchases your product) using at least 3 frames and an icon representing your product

## How to Make Animated Transitions

- One or more frames can be used to build an animation that occurs on page transition (following the same principles from the "Animation with Custom Easing" section)

## Class Project 19 - Page Transition

- Add an animation that occurs on  page transition between the Home page and the Product Details page when the "Learn More" button is clicked on the Home page
