# Wireframing - Low Fidelity

## What is LoFi vs HiFi Wireframing?

- Lo-fi (low fidelity) wireframes are the basic outlines of a web page, website, or application using simple shapes and almost no colors

- Hi-fi (high fidelity) wireframes are detailed designs of a web page, website, or application using real images, typography, color palettes, etc in enough detail that they can be reproduced exactly by a web developer when they are coding the final version of the web page/website/app

## Creating the Design File and Introducing Frames in Figma

- Frames can be thought of as pages of a website or application and can be created in any size
