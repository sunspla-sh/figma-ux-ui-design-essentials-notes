# Autolayouts and Constraints

## Autolayout and Constraint

- Adding an autolayout to a rectangle with text will convert it into a frame with an autolayout property, which automatically adjusts the frame dimensions to fit the inner text

## Class Project 11 - Buttons

- Make three buttons using autolayouts with the following text:

    - "Buy Now"
    - "Learn More"
    - "Purchase"

## Autolayout for Spacing

- Autolayouts can be set to vertically or horizontally stack the objects/text inside of them

## How to Use Constraints

- Constraints can be used to create responsive lofi and hifi wireframes

- Constraints only work within the context of a Figma frame

## Combining Nested Frames with Autolayouts and Constraints

- Reusable, responsive frames can be created for use across multiple different screen sizes by using nested frames with properly configured autolayouts and constraints

## Adding Text Box Autoheight to Autolayout

- Autoheight text boxes within autolayouts will automatically increase the size of the autolayout frame when more text is added to the text box

## Class Project 12 - Responsive Design

- Add a mobile menu, mobile reviews page, and responsive desktop feature cards using autolayouts and constraints as needed

## Nice Drop Shadow and Inner Drop Shadow Effects

- Drop shadow is added to the outside of objects

    - Often useful to add to the bottom of buttons

- Inner shadow is added to the inside of shapes

    - Often useful to add to the inside of switches/toggles
