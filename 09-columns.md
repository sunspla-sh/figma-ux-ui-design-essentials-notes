## How to Work with Columns and Grids

- Columns and grids are typically used to standardize application layout and line up different sections of pages properly

- When designing web pages, it is common to use columns instead of grids, because the web pages will need to work across devices of various screen sizes(from mobile to desktop) and in various device modes (landscape or portrait mode)

    - The most frequently used number of columns for designing desktop web pages is 12

    - The most frequently used number of columns for designing mobile web pages is either 6 or 12

- When designing mobile apps, it is common to use grids instead of columns because the app will only be for mobile phones and most mobile app frameworks are built around grids

    - The most frequently used grid size is 8 pixels
