# Type, Color, and Icon Introduction

## The Basics of Type and Fonts

- Three types of text boxes in Figma:

    - Auto-Width Box

        - Allows typing with unlimited width

    - Auto-Height Box

        - Allows typing with unlimited height

    - Fixed Size Box

        - Allows typing within the bounds of the box

## Rectangles, Circles, Buttons, and Rounded Corners

- No notes

## How to Use Color

- Eyedropper tool allows selection of existing colors for reuse

## Strokes and Updating Color Defaults

- Stroke width around shapes can be set individually for each shape or set as a default property

- In lofi wireframes it is common to add image placeholders, denoted by rectangles with diagonal lines crossing between the corners

## Object Editing Mode

- Allows control over individual constituent lines, background, etc of an object (such as a rectangle, circle, line etc)

## Scale vs Selection Tool

- Selection tool can change the size of an object

- Scale tool can change the size of an object and also scale its properties (such as stroke width) to match the new object size

    - Additionally it will scale text that has been selected

## Frames vs Groups

- Both frames and groups allow the selection of multiple objects at once, to allow for simultaneous reorganization and resizing

- Unlike groups, frames can have constraints on the objects inside the frame that lock them into relative positions

    - Additionally, effects such as scrolling and content clipping/masking can be added to frames (but not to groups)

## Class Project 02 - Wireframe

- Create lofi wireframes for a home page, a product details page, a checkout page, and a confirmation page

## Where to Get Free Icons

- Prefer SVGs over other formats because they scale up or down without loss of image quality

- Look in Figma Community for free icons

## Matching the Stroke of our Icons

- Stroke can be adjusted manually in Figma for imported SVGs

## How to Use Plugins in Figma

- Plugins are third-party tools that extend the default Figma functionality

## Class Project 03 - Icons

- Add social media icons to the confirmation page so that your users can share their most recent purchases
