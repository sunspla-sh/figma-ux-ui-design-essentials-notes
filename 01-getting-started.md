## What is Figma?

- Figma is a User Interface and User Experience design tool

## What is the Difference between UI and UX in Figma?

- User Interface (UI) design is the process of designing the layout and style of web pages and applications

- User Experience (UX) design is the process of collecting feedback from potential users of a prototype application or website (or actual users of a live application) and then determining how best to incorporate that feedback into the user interface

## What are we making in this Figma course?

- Wireframes, style guides, animations, briefs, personas, task flows etc.

### What is a Persona?

- A persona is a short description of the ideal user of a website or application

- Personas are used to help designers build for that ideal user, so that the end product will hopefully contain less of their own biases and be more focused towards the target users

### What is a Task Flow?

- A task flow is a series of steps or actions taken by the user to produce a desired effect within the website or application

- Example task flow for an eCommerce purchase:

    1. Homepage/Marketing Page

    2. Product Features

    3. Checkout

    4. Confirmation

- Task flows are simpler than user flows, because user flows will typically involve design trees, examples of interactions depending on the current page, etc.
