## Tips and Tricks for Using Images

- Images can be set as fills for easy use as backgrounds

## Masking and Cropping Images

- "Fill" stretches an image over an entire object with no direct control of which portion of the image is displayed and which is left outside the viewing window of the object

- "Crop" moves an image around within a given viewing window of an object, allowing you to change which section of the image is visible and which is not

- "Masking" is an intersection of two objects or text
