## How to Change the Thumbnail for Figma Files

- It is possible to set any individual frame to be the cover thumbnail image for the Figma file by right-clicking the individual frame and then selecting the "Set as thumbnail" option

- Alternatively, make a separate page and name it something representative such as "Cover page" or "Thumbnail page", then add a new frame with a size of "Plugin/file cover" (which can be found in the Figma Community accordion section of the Frame section of the Design panel when the frame tool is currently active)

    - The advantage of this specific frame size is that it is appropriately sized to act as the thumbnail of any Figma file or plugin

    - After adding objects or images to the frame, right-click the frame and select the "Set as thumbnail" option so that the frame will be used as the cover thumbnail image for the Figma file
