# Effects

## Blur Layer, Background Blur, and Image Blur

- Image blur is an effect that will blur an image when applied

- Layer blur is an effect that will blur an entire object when applied

- Background blur will only work on partially transparent backgrounds and will blur whatever is behind the object that has the background blur effect applied to it

## How to Make Neumorphic UI Buttons

- Neumorphism is a design style where buttons and other interactive features appear to protrude from or dent into the background rather than float on top of it

- Add two dark drop shadows to the bottom right and two light drop shadows to the top left

    - Adjust x, y, blur, and spread variables for desired effect
