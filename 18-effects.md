## Blur Layer, Background Blur, and Image Blur

- Image blur is an effect that will blur an image when applied

- Layer blur is an effect that will blur an entire object when applied

- Background blur will only work on partially transparent backgrounds and will blur whatever is behind the object that has the background blur effect applied to it
