## How to Make Components into Variants

- Variants are differently styled versions of the same component e.g. dark mode and light mode for buttons

- Select multiple components and click the "Combine as variants" button in the design panel

## Another Way to Make Variants

- Additionally you can create a variant from the properties section of the design panel

## How to Make Multi-Dimensional Variants
