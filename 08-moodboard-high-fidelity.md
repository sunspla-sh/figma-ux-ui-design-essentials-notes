## How to Create a Mood Board

- A mood board is a collage of images, colors, themes etc that are used to guide the design process and overall look-and-feel of the project

- If the mood board is for internal use only (not sending it to a client) you can screenshot various images for inspiration and drop them in a frame on one of the pages in your Figma file

- If the mood board will be shared with a client, consider using a pre-built mood board layout from the Figma community and adding images for inspiration in a tidy and orderly manner

    - This makes the direction of future designs more clear to the client and other stakeholders
