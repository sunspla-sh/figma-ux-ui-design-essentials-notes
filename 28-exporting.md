# Exporting

## How to Export Images Out of Figma

- Any Figma frame or object can be exported as an SVG, JPG, PNG, PDF, etc. by using the Export section within the Design panel

- After making changes to your objects and frames, you can re-export the updated versions through the Figma settings menu by selecting the File -> Export... option, then choosing which objects and frames you'd like to re-export from the modal that appears

## How to Share Your Document with Clients and Stakeholders

- Entire pages can be exported as a PDF, which will include all top-level frames on the page and their associated contents

- The Slice tool can be used to select only specific regions of a page for export

- The Share button can be used to give individuals either "view" or "edit" access to a Figma file

## Talking to Your Developer Early in the Design Process

- Ask developers for feedback on your wireframes, because involving them early in the process will reduce the number of revisions needed later (saving both groups time and keeping the project on schedule)

## Sharing Figma with Developers and Engineers

- Switch on "Dev" mode (the toggle switch near the "Share" button) before sharing with developers, because "Dev" mode, unlike "Design" mode, will include CSS styles, colors, and other developer-related info to speed up the development process

## What are the Next Level Handoffs? (Design Systems)

- Design systems describe not only your design decisions and constraints, but also why you've chosen them and how you are following them

    - Design systems typically include Components, Patterns, Logos, Icons, etc.
