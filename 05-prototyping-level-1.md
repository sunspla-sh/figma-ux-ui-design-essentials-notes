# Prototyping - Level 1

## How to Prototype

- Frames (and objects within frames) can be connected to other frames using Figma's prototyping system

    - Different click effects can be added to the connected frames in order to trigger animations, navigations between frames, etc

- Currently it is not possible to prototype between different pages, only between frames on the same page

## Prototype Animation and Easing

- Animations for navigations within your prototype can be chosen from a series of defaults created by Figma

- Alternatively, you can create entirely custom animations for your prototypes

## Testing on Your Phone with Figma Mirror

- The Figma app (from the iPhone app store or Android app store) allows testing prototypes on a smartphone for a more realistic experience

## Class Project 04 - Testing on Your Phone

- Test your prototype on your smartphone with the Figma app
